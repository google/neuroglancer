Translating cross-section views in-plane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can translate a :ref:`cross-section view<cross-section-view>` in-plane by
left-clicking within the view and dragging the mouse while holding down the left
button. As you drag, the `global center position` changes but the :ref:`global mouse
position<global-mouse-position>` remains fixed.

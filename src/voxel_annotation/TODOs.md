## TODOs

### priority

- url completion for the ssa+https source
- fix the case of multiple datasources in the same layer

### later

- add preview for the undo/redo
- the flood fill sometimes leaves artifacts in sharp areas (maybe increase fillBorderRegion() radius)

### questionable

- write a testsuite for the downsampler and ensure its proper working on exotic lod levels
- design a dataset creation feature
- adapt the brush size to the zoom level linearly

The Stateless S3 Authenticator (SSA) is an authentication service that uses an OIDC portal to verify user identity. It then generates secure, temporary, pre-signed URLs that allow Neuroglancer to directly read from and write to private S3 buckets.
See [TODO: link the github here after its creation...] for more details.

## Shortcut to reload mesh
`Ctrl + Shift + LeftClick` on any visible segment in 2D/3D to reload its mesh after an edit.
This helps avoid having to refresh Neuroglancer to see the new mesh.

NOTE: You may need to do this more than once because Neuroglancer cannot know if the remeshing process has completed.

# TODO List
- optimize drawing tools (they are not really responsive rn)
- add color picker
- Fix the orientation of the disk in the brush tool 
- the uncaching of chunks the VoxSource is working great but since it has no way of knowing which chunks are in view it will delete them causing flickering of the drawings.
